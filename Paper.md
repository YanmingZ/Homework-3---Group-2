## Research on DODODex applying Proactive AMM

### 2. The machanism of DODODex

In traditional AMMs, liquidity providers (LPs) deposit equal amounts of two assets into a pool and receive tokens representing their share of the pool. Trades occur by swapping one asset for another, and the price is determined based on the ratio of the two assets in the pool. However, when there is high demand for one asset and low demand for another, the price can become volatile and lead to impermanent loss for LPs. Proactive AMMs aim to mitigate this risk by dynamically adjusting the pool ratio based on recent trades and external data from Oracle.
